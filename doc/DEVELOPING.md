# Developing

This project can run fully in local dev without setting up PostgreSQL manually.

## Deployment Modes

For mode definitions and intended CLI behavior, see `doc/DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md`.

Current implementation status:

- canonical model: `local_trusted` and `authenticated` (with `private/public` exposure)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+

## Dependency Lockfile Policy

GitHub Actions owns `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

- Do not commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` in pull requests.
- Pull request CI runs on `development` and `master`.
- Feature branches merge into `development` first, where CI blocks manual lockfile edits and validates dependency resolution when manifests change.
- Pushes to `development` regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `pnpm install --lockfile-only --no-frozen-lockfile`, commit it back if needed, and then run verification with `--frozen-lockfile`.
- Promotion PRs from `development` to `master` may include the CI-owned lockfile update from `development`.

## Start the App

If you are not sure which command to use, run:

```sh
pnpm start
```

`pnpm start` is the simplest local entrypoint. It:

1. runs a startup preflight
2. resolves the local startup context safely for this checkout
3. tells you directly if the local install is incomplete
4. launches the app without watch mode

Startup context precedence:

1. explicit `PAPERCLIP_HOME`, `PAPERCLIP_INSTANCE_ID`, or `PAPERCLIP_CONFIG`
2. repo-local startup profile at `.paperclip/local-start.json`
3. interactive chooser in a TTY
4. fail-fast with the exact repair command in non-interactive mode

On the first ambiguous launch in a terminal, Paperclip prompts for the instance/config to use and saves that choice in `.paperclip/local-start.json` for this checkout. `pnpm dev` reuses the same saved profile.

Repin or clear the repo-local startup profile:

```sh
pnpm start -- --choose-startup
pnpm start -- --clear-startup-profile
pnpm dev -- --choose-startup
```

Inspect the pinned profile and recent launch history for this checkout:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai doctor --launch-history
```

If startup says dependencies are incomplete, rerun `pnpm install`. If the problem persists, remove `node_modules` and reinstall once.

Generated env files such as the adjacent agent-JWT `.env` now quote special-character values automatically, so spaces, `#`, and quotes round-trip safely.

## Start Dev

From repo root:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

If you are actively changing code and want watch mode instead, run:

```sh
pnpm dev
```

This starts:

- API server: `http://localhost:3100`
- UI: served by the API server in dev middleware mode (same origin as API)

`pnpm dev` runs the server in watch mode and restarts on changes from workspace packages (including adapter packages). Use `pnpm dev:once` to run without file watching.

## Issue Assignment Shortcuts

Operator-facing issue surfaces now support both agent and user assignees cleanly.

- `Me` assigns or filters to the currently authenticated board user.
- `No assignee` clears both `assigneeAgentId` and `assigneeUserId`.
- `Assign to requester` stays available when the requester is different from the current board user.
- User assignees render as `Me`, `Board`, or a short stable id for other users.

This applies to list filters, assignee grouping, row-level assignment popovers, and issue detail properties.

## New Issue Keyboard Flow

The new issue dialog keeps keyboard-first behavior while avoiding unnecessary stops on prefilled fields.

- `Tab` from the title field jumps to the next empty field.
- If assignee and project are both already prefilled, `Tab` jumps straight to the description editor.
- User assignee selections now persist through local draft restore the same way agent assignees do.
- Recent-assignee tracking still applies only to agent selections.

Tailscale/private-auth dev mode:

```sh
pnpm dev -- --tailscale-auth
```

This runs dev as `authenticated/private` and binds the server to `0.0.0.0` for private-network access.

Allow additional private hostnames (for example custom Tailscale hostnames):

```sh
pnpm paperclipai allowed-hostname dotta-macbook-pro
```

## One-Command Local Run

For the simplest local run from this repo checkout, use:

```sh
pnpm start
```

`pnpm start` is the standard repo-local answer to "what command starts the app?"

## Docker Quickstart (No local Node install)

Build and run Paperclip in Docker:

```sh
docker build -t paperclip-local .
docker run --name paperclip \
  -p 3100:3100 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e PAPERCLIP_HOME=/paperclip \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/docker-paperclip:/paperclip" \
  paperclip-local
```

Or use Compose:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.quickstart.yml up --build
```

See `doc/DOCKER.md` for API key wiring (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and persistence details.

## Database in Dev (Auto-Handled)

For local development, leave `DATABASE_URL` unset.
The server will automatically use embedded PostgreSQL and persist data at the resolved instance path:

- `<paperclipHome>/instances/<instanceId>/db`
- default example when nothing is pinned: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/db`

Override home and instance:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_HOME=/custom/path PAPERCLIP_INSTANCE_ID=dev pnpm start
```

No Docker or external database is required for this mode.

## Storage in Dev (Auto-Handled)

For local development, the default storage provider is `local_disk`, which persists uploaded images/attachments at:

- `<paperclipHome>/instances/<instanceId>/data/storage`
- default example when nothing is pinned: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/data/storage`

Configure storage provider/settings:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai configure --section storage
```

## Default Agent Workspaces

When a local agent run has no resolved project/session workspace, Paperclip falls back to an agent home workspace under the instance root:

- `<paperclipHome>/instances/<instanceId>/workspaces/<agent-id>`
- default example when nothing is pinned: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/workspaces/<agent-id>`

This path honors `PAPERCLIP_HOME` and `PAPERCLIP_INSTANCE_ID` in non-default setups.

## Repo Worktree Bootstrap

Repo-backed project workspaces now hydrate Node dependencies inside each isolated issue worktree before the agent run starts.

- Bootstrap runs only when the checkout contains `package.json`.
- Lockfiles are detected in this order:
  - `pnpm-lock.yaml`
  - `package-lock.json`
  - `npm-shrinkwrap.json`
  - `yarn.lock`
  - `bun.lock`
  - `bun.lockb`
- Install commands:
  - `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`
  - `npm ci`
  - `yarn install --frozen-lockfile`
  - `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
- Paperclip skips the reinstall when `node_modules` is already present and the saved lockfile hash / install command still match the checkout metadata.
- If the required package manager is missing or install fails, the run fails early with a workspace bootstrap error instead of continuing into missing-module TypeScript noise.

The bootstrap state is stored on the active `workspace_checkouts.metadata.workspaceBootstrap` record so operators can inspect what happened on a given checkout.

## Repo Review Handoff

Repo-backed issue runs now expose additional environment variables to local adapters:

- `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_CWD`
- `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_CHECKOUT_ID`
- `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_BRANCH`
- `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_REPO_URL`
- `PAPERCLIP_WORKSPACE_REPO_REF`

When an agent finishes repo-backed work, the expected handoff is:

1. commit on the isolated checkout branch
2. push that branch
3. open a pull request
4. update the issue to `in_review` or `done` with a `comment` and `reviewSubmission`

`reviewSubmission` includes:

- `checkoutId`
- `branchName`
- `headCommitSha`
- `pullRequestUrl`
- optional `remoteBranchName`
- optional `pullRequestNumber`
- optional `pullRequestTitle`

Paperclip persists that PR metadata on the workspace checkout and appends it to the review handoff comment for the manager/creator/project lead reviewer.

## Run Logs and Events

Heartbeat runs now keep both layers of observability:

- full raw stdout/stderr chunks in the NDJSON run log store
- structured `heartbeat_run_events` rows derived from machine-readable adapter stdout when available

For supported local adapters (`codex_local`, `claude_local`, `cursor`, `opencode_local`, and `pi_local`), Paperclip persists assistant output, reasoning, tool calls/results, command execution events, adapter session/result events, and stderr lines as structured run events. The UI prefers these structured events for transcripts and the Events panel, while older runs still fall back to raw log parsing.

## Quick Health Checks

In another terminal:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3100/api/health
curl http://localhost:3100/api/companies
```

Expected:

- `/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- `/api/companies` returns a JSON array

## Reset Local Dev Database

To wipe local dev data and start fresh:

```sh
# Example for the default home/instance only. If this checkout is pinned to a
# different startup profile, use the DB path shown in the startup banner or
# `pnpm paperclipai doctor --launch-history` instead.
rm -rf ~/.paperclip/instances/default/db
pnpm dev
```

## Optional: Use External Postgres

If you set `DATABASE_URL`, the server will use that instead of embedded PostgreSQL.

## Automatic DB Backups

Paperclip can run automatic DB backups on a timer. Defaults:

- enabled
- every 60 minutes
- retain 30 days
- backup dir: `<paperclipHome>/instances/<instanceId>/data/backups`
- default example when nothing is pinned: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/data/backups`

Configure these in:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai configure --section database
```

Run a one-off backup manually:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai db:backup
# or:
pnpm db:backup
```

Environment overrides:

- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_ENABLED=true|false`
- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES=<minutes>`
- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=<days>`
- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_DIR=/absolute/or/~/path`

## Secrets in Dev

Agent env vars now support secret references. By default, secret values are stored with local encryption and only secret refs are persisted in agent config.

- Default local key path: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/secrets/master.key`
- Resolved key path formula: `<paperclipHome>/instances/<instanceId>/secrets/master.key`
- Override key material directly: `PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`
- Override key file path: `PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY_FILE`

Strict mode (recommended outside local trusted machines):

```sh
PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_STRICT_MODE=true
```

When strict mode is enabled, sensitive env keys (for example `*_API_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`) must use secret references instead of inline plain values.

CLI configuration support:

- `pnpm paperclipai onboard` writes a default `secrets` config section (`local_encrypted`, strict mode off, key file path set) and creates a local key file when needed.
- `pnpm paperclipai configure --section secrets` lets you update provider/strict mode/key path and creates the local key file when needed.
- `pnpm paperclipai doctor` validates secrets adapter configuration and can create a missing local key file with `--repair`.

Migration helper for existing inline env secrets:

```sh
pnpm secrets:migrate-inline-env         # dry run
pnpm secrets:migrate-inline-env --apply # apply migration
```

## Company Deletion Toggle

Company deletion is intended as a dev/debug capability and can be disabled at runtime:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_ENABLE_COMPANY_DELETION=false
```

Default behavior:

- `local_trusted`: enabled
- `authenticated`: disabled

## CLI Client Operations

Paperclip CLI now includes client-side control-plane commands in addition to setup commands.

Quick examples:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai issue list --company-id <company-id>
pnpm paperclipai issue create --company-id <company-id> --title "Investigate checkout conflict"
pnpm paperclipai issue update <issue-id> --status in_progress --comment "Started triage"
```

Set defaults once with context profiles:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai context set --api-base http://localhost:3100 --company-id <company-id>
```

Then run commands without repeating flags:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai issue list
pnpm paperclipai dashboard get
```

See full command reference in `doc/CLI.md`.

## OpenClaw Invite Onboarding Endpoints

Agent-oriented invite onboarding now exposes machine-readable API docs:

- `GET /api/invites/:token` returns invite summary plus onboarding and skills index links.
- `GET /api/invites/:token/onboarding` returns onboarding manifest details (registration endpoint, claim endpoint template, skill install hints).
- `GET /api/invites/:token/onboarding.txt` returns a plain-text onboarding doc intended for both human operators and agents (llm.txt-style handoff), including optional inviter message and suggested network host candidates.
- `GET /api/skills/index` lists available skill documents.
- `GET /api/skills/paperclip` returns the Paperclip heartbeat skill markdown.

## OpenClaw Join Smoke Test

Run the end-to-end OpenClaw join smoke harness:

```sh
pnpm smoke:openclaw-join
```

What it validates:

- invite creation for agent-only join
- agent join request using `adapterType=openclaw`
- board approval + one-time API key claim semantics
- callback delivery on wakeup to a dockerized OpenClaw-style webhook receiver

Required permissions:

- This script performs board-governed actions (create invite, approve join, wakeup another agent).
- In authenticated mode, run with board auth via `PAPERCLIP_AUTH_HEADER` or `PAPERCLIP_COOKIE`.

Optional auth flags (for authenticated mode):

- `PAPERCLIP_AUTH_HEADER` (for example `Bearer ...`)
- `PAPERCLIP_COOKIE` (session cookie header value)

## OpenClaw Docker UI One-Command Script

To boot OpenClaw in Docker and print a host-browser dashboard URL in one command:

```sh
pnpm smoke:openclaw-docker-ui
```

This script lives at `scripts/smoke/openclaw-docker-ui.sh` and automates clone/build/config/start for Compose-based local OpenClaw UI testing.

Pairing behavior for this smoke script:

- default `OPENCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH=1` (no Control UI pairing prompt for local smoke; no extra pairing env vars required)
- set `OPENCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH=0` to require standard device pairing

Model behavior for this smoke script:

- defaults to OpenAI models (`openai/gpt-5.2` + OpenAI fallback) so it does not require Anthropic auth by default

State behavior for this smoke script:

- defaults to isolated config dir `~/.openclaw-paperclip-smoke`
- resets smoke agent state each run by default (`OPENCLAW_RESET_STATE=1`) to avoid stale provider/auth drift

Networking behavior for this smoke script:

- auto-detects and prints a Paperclip host URL reachable from inside OpenClaw Docker
- default container-side host alias is `host.docker.internal` (override with `PAPERCLIP_HOST_FROM_CONTAINER` / `PAPERCLIP_HOST_PORT`)
- if Paperclip rejects container hostnames in authenticated/private mode, allow `host.docker.internal` via `pnpm paperclipai allowed-hostname host.docker.internal` and restart Paperclip
