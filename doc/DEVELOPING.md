# Developing

This project can run fully in local dev without setting up PostgreSQL manually.

## Deployment Modes

For mode definitions and intended CLI behavior, see `doc/DEPLOYMENT-MODES.md`.

Current implementation status:

- canonical model: `local_trusted` and `authenticated` (with `private/public` exposure)

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- pnpm 9+

## Dependency Lockfile Policy

GitHub Actions owns `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

- Do not commit `pnpm-lock.yaml` in pull requests.
- Pull request CI validates dependency resolution when manifests change.
- Pushes to `master` regenerate `pnpm-lock.yaml` with `pnpm install --lockfile-only --no-frozen-lockfile`, commit it back if needed, and then run verification with `--frozen-lockfile`.

## Start Dev

From repo root:

```sh
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

This starts:

- API server: `http://localhost:3100`
- UI: served by the API server in dev middleware mode (same origin as API)

`pnpm dev` runs the server in watch mode and restarts on changes from workspace packages (including adapter packages). Use `pnpm dev:once` to run without file watching.

Tailscale/private-auth dev mode:

```sh
pnpm dev --tailscale-auth
```

This runs dev as `authenticated/private` and binds the server to `0.0.0.0` for private-network access.

Allow additional private hostnames (for example custom Tailscale hostnames):

```sh
pnpm paperclipai allowed-hostname dotta-macbook-pro
```

## One-Command Local Run

For a first-time local install, you can bootstrap and run in one command:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai run
```

`paperclipai run` does:

1. auto-onboard if config is missing
2. `paperclipai doctor` with repair enabled
3. starts the server when checks pass

## Docker Quickstart (No local Node install)

Use `docker-compose.yml` as the canonical local Docker entrypoint for this repo.
Keep any personal tweaks in an ignored override file such as `docker-compose.override.yml`.
For this repo's normal local workflow, point Docker quickstart at `./.paperclip-local` so it shares the same Paperclip home as `ops/local/*`.

Build and run Paperclip in Docker:

```sh
docker build -t paperclip-local .
docker run --name paperclip \
  -p 3100:3100 \
  -e HOST=0.0.0.0 \
  -e PAPERCLIP_HOME=/paperclip \
  -v "$(pwd)/data/docker-paperclip:/paperclip" \
  paperclip-local
```

Or use Compose:

```sh
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build
```

Recommended local rule:

- use `docker-compose.yml` for containerized local runs
- use `pnpm dev` only when you want watch mode / fast code iteration
- use `./.paperclip-local` as the one canonical local Paperclip home
- keep local Docker overrides out of git
- do not alternate between `./.paperclip-local` and `~/.paperclip` for the same repo

See `doc/DOCKER.md` for API key wiring (`OPENAI_API_KEY` / `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`) and persistence details.

For `claude_local` / `codex_local`, `Local subscription / login` always happens in the Paperclip runtime environment.
With `pnpm dev`, that is your local machine. With `docker-compose.yml`, that is the Paperclip container/runtime, not your host shell session.

## Database in Dev (Auto-Handled)

For local development, leave `DATABASE_URL` unset.
The server will automatically use embedded PostgreSQL and persist data at:

- `./.paperclip-local/instances/default/db` when using `ops/local/*`
- whatever `PAPERCLIP_HOME` points at in custom setups

Override home and instance:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_HOME=/custom/path PAPERCLIP_INSTANCE_ID=dev pnpm paperclipai run
```

No Docker or external database is required for this mode.

## Storage in Dev (Auto-Handled)

For local development, the default storage provider is `local_disk`, which persists uploaded images/attachments at:

- `./.paperclip-local/instances/default/data/storage` when using `ops/local/*`
- whatever `PAPERCLIP_HOME` points at in custom setups

Configure storage provider/settings:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai configure --section storage
```

You can also update instance-level settings from the board UI at `Settings`.

Currently editable from the UI:

- Storage provider, S3 bucket/region/endpoint/prefix, and local disk path
- Optional static S3 credentials for the instance, with fallback to env / IAM when cleared
- Automatic database backup schedule and backup directory
- Heartbeat scheduler and agent runtime sync settings
- Default auth mode for new `claude_local` and `codex_local` agents, including optional instance API keys
- A Claude shared-auth flow that runs `claude auth login` in the Paperclip runtime environment and stores the shared config under the instance runtime directory
- A Codex subscription wizard that runs `codex login --device-auth` in the Paperclip runtime environment and stores the shared session under the instance runtime directory
- Default secrets provider, strict mode, and local encrypted key path

Notes:

- Existing agents are not migrated when you change instance auth defaults; only new agents pick up the new mode.
- If you disable instance API-key usage for new Claude/Codex agents, Paperclip explicitly forces subscription/local-login auth for those newly created agents.
- Codex subscription login from the board UI is shared for the instance runtime. Agents only use it when their auth mode is set to `Local subscription / login`.
- For S3, you can either store static credentials in instance settings or leave them empty to keep using env / IAM / the default AWS credential chain.

## Default Agent Workspaces

When a local agent run has no resolved project/session workspace, Paperclip falls back to an agent home workspace under the instance root:

- `./.paperclip-local/instances/default/workspaces/<agent-id>` when using `ops/local/*`
- whatever `PAPERCLIP_HOME` points at in custom setups

This path honors `PAPERCLIP_HOME` and `PAPERCLIP_INSTANCE_ID` in non-default setups.

## Quick Health Checks

In another terminal:

```sh
curl http://localhost:3100/api/health
curl http://localhost:3100/api/companies
```

Expected:

- `/api/health` returns `{"status":"ok"}`
- `/api/companies` returns a JSON array

## Reset Local Dev Database

To wipe local dev data and start fresh:

```sh
rm -rf ./.paperclip-local/instances/default/db
pnpm dev
```

## Optional: Use External Postgres

If you set `DATABASE_URL`, the server will use that instead of embedded PostgreSQL.

## Automatic DB Backups

Paperclip can run automatic DB backups on a timer. Defaults:

- enabled
- every 60 minutes
- retain 30 days
- backup dir: `./.paperclip-local/instances/default/data/backups` when using `ops/local/*`

Configure these in:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai configure --section database
```

Run a one-off backup manually:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai db:backup
# or:
pnpm db:backup
```

Environment overrides:

- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_ENABLED=true|false`
- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_INTERVAL_MINUTES=<minutes>`
- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_RETENTION_DAYS=<days>`
- `PAPERCLIP_DB_BACKUP_DIR=/absolute/or/~/path`

## Secrets in Dev

Agent env vars now support secret references. By default, secret values are stored with local encryption and only secret refs are persisted in agent config.

- Default local key path: `~/.paperclip/instances/default/secrets/master.key`
- With `ops/local/*`, that resolves to `./.paperclip-local/instances/default/secrets/master.key`
- Override key material directly: `PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY`
- Override key file path: `PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_MASTER_KEY_FILE`

Strict mode (recommended outside local trusted machines):

```sh
PAPERCLIP_SECRETS_STRICT_MODE=true
```

When strict mode is enabled, sensitive env keys (for example `*_API_KEY`, `*_TOKEN`, `*_SECRET`) must use secret references instead of inline plain values.

CLI configuration support:

- `pnpm paperclipai onboard` writes a default `secrets` config section (`local_encrypted`, strict mode off, key file path set) and creates a local key file when needed.
- `pnpm paperclipai configure --section secrets` lets you update provider/strict mode/key path and creates the local key file when needed.
- `pnpm paperclipai doctor` validates secrets adapter configuration and can create a missing local key file with `--repair`.

Migration helper for existing inline env secrets:

```sh
pnpm secrets:migrate-inline-env         # dry run
pnpm secrets:migrate-inline-env --apply # apply migration
```

## Company Deletion Toggle

Company deletion is intended as a dev/debug capability and can be disabled at runtime:

```sh
PAPERCLIP_ENABLE_COMPANY_DELETION=false
```

Default behavior:

- `local_trusted`: enabled
- `authenticated`: disabled

## CLI Client Operations

Paperclip CLI now includes client-side control-plane commands in addition to setup commands.

Quick examples:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai issue list --company-id <company-id>
pnpm paperclipai issue create --company-id <company-id> --title "Investigate checkout conflict"
pnpm paperclipai issue update <issue-id> --status in_progress --comment "Started triage"
```

Set defaults once with context profiles:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai context set --api-base http://localhost:3100 --company-id <company-id>
```

Then run commands without repeating flags:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai issue list
pnpm paperclipai dashboard get
```

See full command reference in `doc/CLI.md`.

## OpenClaw Invite Onboarding Endpoints

Agent-oriented invite onboarding now exposes machine-readable API docs:

- `GET /api/invites/:token` returns invite summary plus onboarding and skills index links.
- `GET /api/invites/:token/onboarding` returns onboarding manifest details (registration endpoint, claim endpoint template, skill install hints).
- `GET /api/invites/:token/onboarding.txt` returns a plain-text onboarding doc intended for both human operators and agents (llm.txt-style handoff), including optional inviter message and suggested network host candidates.
- `GET /api/skills/index` lists available skill documents.
- `GET /api/skills/paperclip` returns the Paperclip heartbeat skill markdown.

## OpenClaw Join Smoke Test

Run the end-to-end OpenClaw join smoke harness:

```sh
pnpm smoke:openclaw-join
```

What it validates:

- invite creation for agent-only join
- agent join request using `adapterType=openclaw`
- board approval + one-time API key claim semantics
- callback delivery on wakeup to a dockerized OpenClaw-style webhook receiver

Required permissions:

- This script performs board-governed actions (create invite, approve join, wakeup another agent).
- In authenticated mode, run with board auth via `PAPERCLIP_AUTH_HEADER` or `PAPERCLIP_COOKIE`.

Optional auth flags (for authenticated mode):

- `PAPERCLIP_AUTH_HEADER` (for example `Bearer ...`)
- `PAPERCLIP_COOKIE` (session cookie header value)

## OpenClaw Docker UI One-Command Script

To boot OpenClaw in Docker and print a host-browser dashboard URL in one command:

```sh
pnpm smoke:openclaw-docker-ui
```

This script lives at `scripts/smoke/openclaw-docker-ui.sh` and automates clone/build/config/start for Compose-based local OpenClaw UI testing.

Pairing behavior for this smoke script:

- default `OPENCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH=1` (no Control UI pairing prompt for local smoke; no extra pairing env vars required)
- set `OPENCLAW_DISABLE_DEVICE_AUTH=0` to require standard device pairing

Model behavior for this smoke script:

- defaults to OpenAI models (`openai/gpt-5.2` + OpenAI fallback) so it does not require Anthropic auth by default

State behavior for this smoke script:

- defaults to isolated config dir `~/.openclaw-paperclip-smoke`
- resets smoke agent state each run by default (`OPENCLAW_RESET_STATE=1`) to avoid stale provider/auth drift

Networking behavior for this smoke script:

- auto-detects and prints a Paperclip host URL reachable from inside OpenClaw Docker
- default container-side host alias is `host.docker.internal` (override with `PAPERCLIP_HOST_FROM_CONTAINER` / `PAPERCLIP_HOST_PORT`)
- if Paperclip rejects container hostnames in authenticated/private mode, allow `host.docker.internal` via `pnpm paperclipai allowed-hostname host.docker.internal` and restart Paperclip
