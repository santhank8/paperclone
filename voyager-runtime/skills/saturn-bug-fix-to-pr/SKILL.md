# Saturn Bug Fix → Draft PR

Activate when triage has confirmed a genuine bug AND a human has approved a fix attempt.

## Inputs

- Jira ticket key (e.g., `PROD-3712`)
- The failing signature (error, repro steps, affected service)
- The suspected file/function from triage

## Process

### 1. Trace the 5-layer chain FIRST

This is mandatory per Saturn's CLAUDE.md. For every endpoint, route, or feature you touch:

1. Backend/Jupiter/Mars route definition — where is it registered?
2. The view/handler — what does it return?
3. Shuttle proxy config — does shuttle know about this path?
4. Frontend API service file — what URL does the frontend call?
5. Frontend component — what response shape does it expect?

Read all 5 before writing code. If the bug spans layers, fix ALL affected layers in the same PR.

### 2. Reproduce locally (if possible)

The relevant service repo is already on disk at `/Users/bugatt/Downloads/saturn/{service}/`. Use it. If local repro is infeasible (e.g., needs a real firm's data), explain in the PR body why and rely on log-driven diagnosis.

### 3. Create a branch

Branch name format: `voyager/{JIRA-KEY}-{short-slug}`
Base branch: **`dev`** (default) or **`stage`** (stabilization work). **Never `main`. Never `labs`.** If the assignment ticket specifies a base branch, use that. Otherwise default to `dev`.

### 3a. Isolate the work in a clean git worktree

Before editing, check `git status --short`. If the repo is dirty OR the checkout is the same one running a watched local dev server, create a separate git worktree from the target base branch and do the entire fix there. This prevents watch-mode restarts from killing the heartbeat run mid-fix and keeps unrelated local changes out of the PR.

Concrete example:

```bash
git fetch origin
git worktree add /tmp/{service}-{JIRA-KEY} origin/{base-branch} -b voyager/{JIRA-KEY}-{short-slug}
cd /tmp/{service}-{JIRA-KEY}
```

If you cannot get to a clean isolated worktree, stop and report the blocker instead of editing the watched checkout.

### 4. Write the fix

- Don't add features, don't refactor code you didn't change, don't add docstrings you weren't asked for.
- Follow existing patterns in the file you're editing.
- If the file has tests alongside it, update or add tests.
- For Django: **never add new top-level heavy imports** (boto3, pydub, docx, pypdf, litellm, langchain). Import inside function bodies.
- For Mars: **GORM zero-value bool**: `db.Create()` skips `false` → default `true` applies. Fix: Create then Update.
- For Jupiter: **MongoDB database name** baked in image as `jupiter_db`; ECS secrets don't override.

### 5. Verify

- Run the relevant test file (not the whole suite) with the service's test runner:
  - Django: `cd backend && pytest {path/to/test} -x`
  - Mars: `cd mars && go test ./{path/to/package} -run {TestName}`
  - Jupiter: `cd jupiter && pytest {path/to/test} -x`
  - Frontend: `cd frontend && pnpm test {pattern}`
- If the test passes and no linter errors, proceed. If not, iterate — don't open a broken PR.

### 6. Open the draft PR

Use `gh pr create --draft` or the GitHub MCP. Title format:

```
[{JIRA-KEY}] {short human description}
```

PR body must include:

- `## Thinking Path` — trace from PRD/problem to this change
- `## What Changed` — bullet list of concrete changes
- `## Verification` — how a reviewer can confirm it works (exact commands)
- `## Risks` — what could break
- `## Model Used` — the model that produced this change
- `## Jira` — link back to the ticket

The PR is **draft**. The human decides when to mark ready-for-review.

### 7. Link both ways

- Comment on the Jira ticket with the PR URL
- Comment on the PR with the Jira URL
- Reply in the original Slack thread with both links

## Hard rules

- **PR only. Only `dev` and `stage` are valid base branches. Never `main`, never `labs`. Never push directly.**
- **Draft only.**
- **No `--no-verify` on hooks.**
- **No scope creep** — fix the bug, nothing else. If you see other issues, open separate Jira tickets.
- **Every touched layer must be updated.** Changing a backend endpoint without updating shuttle + frontend is a wiring bug, not a fix.
- **Tenant isolation** — make sure the fix doesn't leak cross-firm data.
