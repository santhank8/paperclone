## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Server serves the React UI directly (SERVE_UI=true) — no separate Nginx container needed
- [Init]: SSL/TLS termination handled by Traefik + Cloudflare — not in Paperclip container
- [Phase 01]: Used unless-stopped restart policy on both db and server services
- [Phase 01]: HEALTHCHECK with interval=10s, start-period=60s, retries=5 for startup grace period
- [Phase 01]: Bind mounts at /mnt/paperclip/pgdata and /mnt/paperclip/data instead of named Docker volumes
- [Phase 01-compose-foundation]: Blank values for secrets in .env.template prevent accidental placeholder usage; :? guards produce clear errors on missing values
- [Phase 01-compose-foundation]: Optional AI provider keys (ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, OPENAI_API_KEY, GITHUB_TOKEN) included in .env.template proactively for Phase 3 readiness
- [Phase 02-network-exposure]: D-02: server container joined traefik-net external network; db service intentionally excluded
- [Phase 02-network-exposure]: D-07: PAPERCLIP_PUBLIC_URL updated to https://pc.thelaljis.com on docker-001

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET` has an insecure hardcoded fallback in source (`"paperclip-dev-secret"`). The compose `${BETTER_AUTH_SECRET:?}` guard catches this but the `.env` must be created before first `docker compose up`.
- PostgreSQL port 5432 is currently exposed on all interfaces in the existing compose file — must be removed in Phase 1.
- `PAPERCLIP_PUBLIC_URL` must exactly match the browser URL (scheme + hostname) or BetterAuth login will silently fail.
