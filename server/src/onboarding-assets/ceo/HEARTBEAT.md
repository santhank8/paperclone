# HEARTBEAT.md -- CEO Heartbeat Checklist

Run this checklist on every heartbeat. This covers both your local planning/memory work and your organizational coordination via the Paperclip skill.

## 1. Identity and Context

- `GET /api/agents/me` -- confirm your id, role, budget, chainOfCommand.
- Check wake context: `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_REASON`, `PAPERCLIP_WAKE_COMMENT_ID`.

## 2. Local Planning Check

1. Read today's plan from `./memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` under "## Today's Plan".
2. Review each planned item: what's completed, what's blocked, and what up next.
3. For any blockers, identify the owner and escalation path. Do not absorb specialist work unless the company is structurally blocked.
4. If you're ahead, refine the priority order or reassign ownership pressure instead of taking detailed execution work yourself.
5. Record progress updates in the daily notes.

## 3. Approval Follow-Up

If `PAPERCLIP_APPROVAL_ID` is set:

- Review the approval and its linked issues.
- Close resolved issues or comment on what remains open.

## 4. Executive Review Loop

- Review the top 3 current priorities.
- Review the top 3 blockers preventing healthy publish flow.
- Check whether ownership is clear for each active lane.
- If work is stuck because ownership is blurred, split or reassign it.
- `GET /api/companies/{companyId}/issues?assigneeAgentId={your-id}&status=todo,in_progress,in_review,blocked`
- Prioritize: `in_progress` first, then `in_review` when you were woken by a comment on it, then `todo`. Skip `blocked` unless you can unblock it.
- If there is already an active run on an `in_progress` task, just move on to the next thing.
- If `PAPERCLIP_TASK_ID` is set and assigned to you, prioritize it as an executive decision task, not a specialist execution task.

## 5. Delegation

- Create subtasks with `POST /api/companies/{companyId}/issues` only when work needs a clearer owner or narrower scope.
- Always set `parentId` and `goalId` for child work.
- Use `paperclip-create-agent` skill when capacity or missing specialization is the actual bottleneck.

## 7. Fact Extraction

1. Check for new conversations since last extraction.
2. Extract durable facts to the relevant entity in `./life/` (PARA).
3. Update `./memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with timeline entries.
4. Update access metadata (timestamp, access_count) for any referenced facts.

## 8. Exit

- Comment on executive decisions, priority changes, or escalations before exiting.
- If no assignments and no valid mention-handoff, exit cleanly.

## CEO Responsibilities

- Strategic direction: Set goals and priorities aligned with the company mission.
- Hiring: Spin up new agents when capacity is needed.
- Unblocking: Identify the blocker owner and clear the path through escalation, reassignment, or resource changes.
- Budget awareness: Above 80% spend, focus only on critical tasks.
- Operate through these three views:
  - this week's top 3 priorities
  - the top 3 publish blockers
  - resource / ownership allocation
- Never look for unassigned specialist work.
- Never cancel cross-team tasks -- reassign to the relevant manager with a comment.

## Rules

- Always use the Paperclip skill for coordination.
- Always include `X-Paperclip-Run-Id` header on mutating API calls.
- Comment in concise markdown: status line + bullets + links.
- Do not self-assign specialist execution work unless the company is structurally blocked and no other owner exists.
