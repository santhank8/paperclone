# Self-Improving Agent

Four native phases: **Detect** (violation hooks) → **Capture** (lessons file) → **Apply** (rule refinement) → **Verify** (keep/discard loop). No external tools.

The loop runs *across* sessions, not within them. Each session produces data. The loop consumes it.

## Why Agents Stay Dumb {#why-agents-stay-dumb}

Every session starts cold. No memory of what broke last time. **Session amnesia** means an agent that captures nothing = an agent that repeats everything.

Three failure modes that look like improvement but aren't:

| Failure Mode | What happens |
|---|---|
| Capture without apply | Violations logged, CLAUDE.md never updated — same mistakes next session |
| Apply without verify | Rule changed without testing — scores drop silently |
| Verify without iterate | Loop runs once — improvement never compounds |

**The fix:** make all four phases mandatory. Skipping any one resets the loop to zero.

## The Four-Phase Loop {#the-four-phase-loop}

```
[1 DETECT] ──→ [2 CAPTURE] ──→ [3 APPLY] ──→ [4 VERIFY]
PostToolUse     lessons.md      CLAUDE.md     keep/discard
hook fires      append entry    rewrite rule      ↺ 8x
```

Runs *across* sessions. Each session produces violation data. The loop consumes it before the next session starts.

---

## Phase 1 — Detect: Violation Hooks

PostToolUse hook watches every tool call and classifies violations against `CLAUDE.md` rules.

→ Hook config, violation types, signal/noise routing: [01-violation-hooks.md](references/01-violation-hooks.md)

---

## Phase 2 — Capture: The Lessons File

Threshold: **2+ occurrences** before creating an entry. One session = noise. Two = pattern.

→ Entry format, dedup logic, pruning schedule: [02-lessons-file.md](references/02-lessons-file.md)

---

## Phase 3 — Apply: Rule Refinement

Group by violation type → find top 3 → diagnose why the rule failed → rewrite for specificity.

**The rule test:** read it cold. Do you immediately know what to do? If ambiguous → the rule fails, regardless of how long it's been in `CLAUDE.md`.

→ Diagnosis patterns, before/after examples, update workflow: [03-rule-refinement.md](references/03-rule-refinement.md)

---

## Phase 4 — Verify: Keep/Discard Loop

Run the same test cases before and after every change. Score on two dimensions:

| Metric | Keep if... |
|---|---|
| Trigger test pass rate | ≥80% (no regression from baseline) |
| Output test pass rate | No regression from baseline |
| Line count | Prefer fewer at equal score |

→ 8-iteration protocol, objective scoring, stop conditions: [04-keep-discard-loop.md](references/04-keep-discard-loop.md)

---

## Session-End Summary

Stop hook audits the session: tools called, violations fired, decisions made. Saves a 5-line summary.

```json
{
  "hooks": {
    "Stop": [{"hooks": [{"type": "command", "command": "node ~/.claude/hooks/session-audit.js"}]}]
  }
}
```

→ Full Stop hook, compression format, where to save: [05-session-end-summary.md](references/05-session-end-summary.md)

## Anti-Rationalization

| What you'll tell yourself | The truth |
|---|---|
| "I'll update CLAUDE.md when I see the pattern" | By session 5, session 1 is gone. The hook fires automatically. Wire it now. |
| "This violation only happened once, not a pattern" | Correct — threshold is 2. But you won't remember session 1 happened unless you log it. |
| "My rules are clear, the agent just needs to follow them" | If it was clear, it wouldn't keep breaking. The lesson lives in the violation data, not your intuition. |
| "The keep/discard loop is overkill for a simple change" | One bad rule update cascades across all future sessions. One verification pass costs 10 minutes. |
| "I'll capture everything so I don't miss signal" | Noise beats signal when the lessons file is unreadable. Enforce the 2-occurrence threshold. |
