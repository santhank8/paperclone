# Ubiquitous Language — Domain Glossary for AI Agents

One file. Every session. Claude speaks your domain's language automatically.

## The Problem

Claude defaults to generic naming: "user" instead of "subscriber", "transaction" instead of "settlement", "order" instead of "purchase order". Without a domain glossary, you correct the same terms every session — and the corrections don't stick. The arXiv study (Dec 2025) quantified it: 65% of AI outputs contain terminology inconsistencies without glossaries. METR puts the cost at 19% slower task completion.

The fix: GLOSSARY.md + an `@` reference in CLAUDE.md + a PostToolUse hook. Claude reads your terms before every session and gets flagged when it drifts.

## Quick Setup (3 Steps)

**Step 1 — Create GLOSSARY.md** in your repo root. See [01-glossary-template.md](references/01-glossary-template.md) for format and entry templates. Start with 5-10 terms you've already corrected at least once.

**Step 2 — Wire into CLAUDE.md:**

```
@GLOSSARY.md
```

Add this line to your CLAUDE.md. Claude loads it on every session automatically.

**Step 3 — Install hooks** from [02-hooks.md](references/02-hooks.md):
- `SessionStart` hook: surfaces active glossary count at session start
- `PostToolUse` hook: flags anti-pattern terms in Write/Edit before they land in git

## GLOSSARY.md Structure

Each entry has four fields:

```markdown
## [Term]

**Definition:** What this means in your domain.
**Aliases:** What Claude might write instead — "user", "customer", "record"
**Anti-patterns:** NEVER say: "user", "account" — use "subscriber"
**Usage:** `subscriber.activePlan`, `subscriber.billingCycle`
```

See [01-glossary-template.md](references/01-glossary-template.md) for complete templates by entry type: entity, action, status, relationship. Includes a 10-entry starter for a SaaS subscription domain.

## Extracting Terms from an Existing Codebase

Starting from scratch? See [03-extraction-workflow.md](references/03-extraction-workflow.md) for a cold-start workflow: scan identifiers, scan docs, run the extraction prompt, prioritize by domain impact.

## Maintaining the Glossary

Adding new terms, deprecating old ones, handling team disagreements — see [04-maintenance.md](references/04-maintenance.md). Key rule: treat GLOSSARY.md like your schema. Rename in the glossary first, then refactor the code.

## Composing with Ontology (#012)

GLOSSARY.md = **what we call things**. Ontology knowledge graph = **how things relate**.

Use both together: the ontology defines `Subscriber → hasPlan → Plan`, the glossary enforces that Claude calls it "subscriber" (not "user") and "plan" (not "subscription"). See [05-composability-bridge.md](references/05-composability-bridge.md) for the layered model and derivation workflow.

## Anti-Rationalization

| What you'll tell yourself | The truth |
|---|---|
| "I'll just correct Claude when it gets the naming wrong" | You'll correct it 50 times. It won't remember. The glossary remembers. |
| "Our domain terms aren't that different from generic ones" | Different enough that you noticed. That's why you're here. |
| "I'll set up the PostToolUse hook later" | The hook is 8 lines. "Later" means wrong terms in git for 3 months. |
| "I need to extract all terms before I can start" | Start with 5 terms. Add more as Claude gets them wrong. The glossary grows with the codebase. |
| "CLAUDE.md loads from git root — GLOSSARY.md will auto-load" | It won't. You need the explicit `@GLOSSARY.md` line in CLAUDE.md. |
