# AGENTS.md for Claude Code

AGENTS.md is the declarative manifest for a Claude Code agent — its identity, workflow routing, and tool access in one version-controlled file.

| Component | Purpose | Lives In |
|---|---|---|
| CLAUDE.md | Project context, shared rules, conventions | repo root or `~/.claude/` |
| AGENTS.md | Agent identity, role, workflow routing, tool access | `agents/[role]/AGENTS.md` |
| Hooks | Event-driven automation | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Skills | Reusable capabilities the agent invokes | `~/.claude/skills/` |

## Quick Setup

1. **Create** `agents/[role]/AGENTS.md` with the minimal identity block (name, role, title, capabilities, reportsTo)
2. **Add** a workflow routing table with 3+ trigger patterns mapped to named workflows
3. **Declare** tool access scoped to this agent's actual role

Bootstrap any agent type in under 10 minutes using the copy-paste templates in `references/06-templates.md`.

## What is AGENTS.md

AGENTS.md separates agent-specific configuration from shared project context. An agent's identity, routing logic, and permission boundaries travel with it — not buried in CLAUDE.md.

**Mental model:** CLAUDE.md answers "how does this project work?" AGENTS.md answers "who am I and what do I do?"

## The Split Rule: CLAUDE.md vs AGENTS.md

One rule prevents bloat: **shared project context lives in CLAUDE.md; agent-specific identity, routing, and constraints live in AGENTS.md.**

## Core Structure

Every AGENTS.md has four blocks: identity (name, role, title, capabilities, reportsTo), workflow routing table, tool access declarations, and an anti-rationalization section for the agent's own mandate.

Full annotated template → `references/02-core-structure.md`

## Workflow Routing Tables

The most underused pattern. A routing table makes agent behavior explicit and auditable — trigger patterns mapped to named workflows, no ambiguity.

How to write patterns that fire reliably → `references/03-workflow-routing.md`

## Tool Access Design

Scope tools to the agent's actual role. A researcher doesn't need deploy permissions. A reviewer shouldn't write to production.

**The principle:** start with nothing. Add only what the role explicitly requires.

Tool scoping patterns by agent type → `references/04-tool-access.md`

## Composability Bridge

AGENTS.md wires agents into a team:
- Reference skills with `/skill-name` in capabilities
- Define `reportsTo` for escalation chain
- List authorized data sources
- Document sub-agent coordination patterns

Orchestrator composition patterns → `references/05-composability.md`

## Templates Gallery

| Template | Use For |
|---|---|
| Researcher | Web search, synthesis, brief writing |
| Builder | Implementation, code generation, testing |
| Reviewer | QC, PASS/FAIL decisions, structured feedback |
| Orchestrator | Delegation, coordination, pipeline management |

All four templates → `references/06-templates.md`

## Anti-Patterns and Maintenance

| Anti-Pattern | Failure Mode |
|---|---|
| Instruction dump | Walls of text agents ignore at line 150+ |
| Workflow creep | Agent takes work outside its mandate |
| Permission sprawl | Overprivileged agents cause unexpected side effects |
| Missing anti-rationalization | Agent talks itself out of the hard parts |
| No data sources declared | Agent uses whatever it finds, quality undefined |
| Stale routing tables | Triggers no longer match current workflows |

Audit quarterly: Is routing table current? Does tool access match the role? Any mandate drift?

## Anti-Rationalization

| What you'll tell yourself | The truth |
|---|---|
| "I'll just put this in CLAUDE.md, it's faster" | CLAUDE.md bloat is exactly what AGENTS.md solves. Every agent-specific rule in CLAUDE.md is a maintenance liability across every agent that reads it. |
| "My agents don't need routing tables, prose is fine" | Prose is ambiguous. Routing tables are explicit contracts. Agents skip ambiguous instructions. |
| "I'll configure tool access later" | Underconfigured access = unexpected behavior in production. Set it at creation, not after the first incident. |
| "This template is too much structure for a simple agent" | Simple agents still need identity blocks. Undefined behavior is agent drift. Structure is what keeps "simple" simple. |
| "I already have CLAUDE.md, that's enough" | CLAUDE.md can't express per-agent identity or least-privilege access. Works until you have 3+ agents with conflicting rules. |
