/**
 * Centralized React Query cache key registry.
 *
 * All query keys used throughout the frontend must be defined here. This
 * ensures consistent cache invalidation — when a mutation succeeds, it can
 * call `invalidateQueries({ queryKey: queryKeys.foo.all })` to bust all
 * related caches without needing to know the exact key shapes at the call site.
 *
 * **Key hierarchy convention**
 *
 * Keys are structured as arrays of segments so that React Query's prefix
 * invalidation works correctly:
 *
 * ```
 * queryKeys.plugins.all              → ["plugins"]
 * queryKeys.plugins.detail("p1")    → ["plugins", "p1"]
 * queryKeys.plugins.health("p1")    → ["plugins", "p1", "health"]
 * ```
 *
 * Invalidating `queryKeys.plugins.all` (the prefix `["plugins"]`) will
 * automatically invalidate every `detail`, `health`, and `uiContributions`
 * entry, because React Query matches by prefix.
 *
 * **Adding new keys**
 *
 * 1. Add the key factory here (not inline at the query call site).
 * 2. Use the entity name as the first segment and a descriptor as subsequent
 *    segments so the hierarchy is intuitive.
 * 3. Write tests in `queryKeys.test.ts` to assert the shape and prefix
 *    relationships.
 *
 * @see ui/src/lib/queryKeys.test.ts for coverage of all key shapes
