## Current product surfaces to know about

If the app "looks fine" but the shape is unclear, this is the current mental model:

- `/dashboard`
  - still the narrow telemetry/operations page
  - metric cards, charts, recent activity, recent tasks
  - not the new executive summary surface
- `/briefings/board`
  - new executive board added in the recent merge
  - answers: outcomes landed, risks/blocks, decisions needed, project health, cost anomalies, executive rollups
- `/briefings/results`
  - durable results library
  - where deliverables, findings, blockers, decision outcomes, and status reports now live as first-class records
- `/briefings/plans`
  - durable planning library
  - where strategy memos, project briefs, decision records, operating plans, weekly objectives, and risk registers now live
- `/briefings/briefings`
  - planned next for a dedicated briefing library
  - not shipped yet in the current baseline
- `/briefings/portfolio`
  - planned next for a true portfolio/program surface
  - not shipped yet in the current baseline
- `/knowledge`
  - planned next for durable organizational memory
  - not shipped yet in the current baseline
- `/briefings/records/:recordId`
  - shared detail page for plans, results, and briefings
  - shows markdown body, attachments, linked work, publish state, and activity
- issue / approval / agent run detail pages
  - still part of the operational layer
  - now include "Promote to result" entry points so execution artifacts can become durable outputs

## Recent architecture additions now present in code

The repository now includes a durable executive-record layer in addition to goals/projects/issues/runs:

- DB tables:
  - `records`
  - `record_links`
  - `record_attachments`
  - `briefing_view_states`
- Shared contracts:
  - record categories: `plan`, `result`, `briefing`
  - record scopes: `company`, `project`, `agent`
  - explicit plan/result/briefing kind enums
  - explicit health and pricing-state enums
- Server routes:
  - company-scoped CRUD/list routes for plans, results, and briefings
  - board summary endpoint at `/api/companies/:companyId/briefings/board`
  - shared record detail/mutation routes under `/api/records/:recordId/*`
  - generic asset upload route at `/api/companies/:companyId/assets/files`
- UI routes:
  - `/briefings`
  - `/briefings/board`
  - `/briefings/results`
  - `/briefings/plans`
  - `/briefings/records/:recordId`

## Security/runtime corrections included in the merged feature work

The recent executive-record work also shipped follow-up fixes:

- generic `/assets/files` uploads are now limited to inert document MIME types
- asset responses add `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- project health is derived from the full blocker/decision sets before the board truncates visible lists
- server tests now cover those regressions

## Major gaps still open after the first executive-layer merge

- no dedicated briefing library yet
- no scheduled digest generation yet
- no knowledge library/index yet
- no project milestones model yet
- no dedicated portfolio/program page yet
- no worktree-backed workspace isolation yet
- no pricing-state propagation across all cost surfaces yet

## Source/build artifacts present

The repository currently includes built output directories such as:

- `server/dist/`
- `ui/dist/`
- `cli/dist/`
- `packages/*/dist/`

`node_modules/` is present locally.

## Docs layout

Two documentation trees exist and are both active in-repo:

- `docs/` (Mintlify-oriented docs, includes API/deploy/start/adapters sections)
- `doc/` (engineering notes/specs/plans and legacy/internal docs)

## Test footprint (high-level)

Verified first-party tests include:

- `server/src/__tests__/*.test.ts`
- `cli/src/__tests__/*.test.ts`
- `packages/adapters/opencode-local/src/server/*.test.ts`
- `packages/adapters/pi-local/src/server/*.test.ts`

(Repository also contains many dependency tests under `node_modules/`, which are not project-authored tests.)

## Quick validation commands

Use these for lightweight local validation:

```bash
git status -sb
git branch --format='%(refname:short)'
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm test:run
```
