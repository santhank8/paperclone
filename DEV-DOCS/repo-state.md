## Current product surfaces to know about

If the app "looks fine" but the shape is unclear, this is the current mental model:

- `/dashboard`
  - still the narrow telemetry/operations page
  - metric cards, charts, recent activity, recent tasks
  - now also includes `System Health` with subsystem diagnostics
- `/roadmap`
  - operator-facing strategic backlog
  - backed by the existing `goals` model
  - grouped by `now / next / later`
  - carries manager-facing guidance text
- `/briefings/board`
  - new executive board added in the recent merge
  - answers: outcomes landed, risks/blocks, decisions needed, project health, cost anomalies, executive rollups
- `/briefings/results`
  - durable results library
  - where deliverables, findings, blockers, decision outcomes, and status reports now live as first-class records
- `/briefings/plans`
  - durable planning library
  - where strategy memos, project briefs, decision records, operating plans, weekly objectives, and risk registers now live
- `/briefings/briefings`
  - briefing library for briefing records/templates/instances
- `/briefings/portfolio`
  - dedicated portfolio/program board
- `/knowledge`
  - lightweight knowledge library for published durable outputs
- `/briefings/records/:recordId`
  - shared detail page for plans, results, and briefings
  - shows markdown body, attachments, linked work, publish state, and activity
- issue / approval / agent run detail pages
  - still part of the operational layer
  - now include "Promote to result" entry points so execution artifacts can become durable outputs
  - agent run detail exposes persisted workspace-isolation metadata such as checkout path and branch
  - agent run detail now prefers structured run events for transcript/event rendering when a local adapter emits them
  - repo-backed review handoffs can attach branch/commit/PR metadata to the issue comment and active checkout row
- `/company/settings`
  - includes default manager planning mode
- agent create/edit/detail surfaces
  - include manager planning mode override and resolved planning mode visibility
  - `openclaw_gateway` create mode now exposes the full gateway config, not only the base URL

## Recent architecture additions now present in code

The repository now includes a durable executive-record layer in addition to goals/projects/issues/runs:

- DB tables:
  - `records`
  - `record_links`
  - `record_attachments`
  - `briefing_view_states`
  - `briefing_schedules`
  - `knowledge_entries`
  - `project_milestones`
  - `workspace_checkouts`
- Shared contracts:
  - record categories: `plan`, `result`, `briefing`
  - record scopes: `company`, `project`, `agent`
  - explicit plan/result/briefing kind enums
  - explicit health and pricing-state enums
  - explicit manager planning mode enums
  - subsystem health response types
  - issue review-submission metadata for repo-backed handoff
- Server routes:
  - company-scoped CRUD/list routes for plans, results, and briefings
  - board summary endpoint at `/api/companies/:companyId/briefings/board`
  - portfolio summary endpoint at `/api/companies/:companyId/briefings/portfolio`
  - shared record detail/mutation routes under `/api/records/:recordId/*`
  - schedule routes under `/api/records/:recordId/schedule`
  - knowledge routes under `/api/companies/:companyId/knowledge` and `/api/knowledge/:entryId`
  - milestone CRUD under `/api/projects/:id/milestones`
  - generic asset upload route at `/api/companies/:companyId/assets/files`
  - roadmap aliases at `/api/companies/:companyId/roadmap` and `/api/roadmap/:id`
  - subsystem diagnostics at `/api/health/subsystems`
- UI routes:
  - `/briefings`
  - `/briefings/board`
  - `/briefings/briefings`
  - `/briefings/results`
  - `/briefings/plans`
  - `/briefings/portfolio`
  - `/briefings/records/:recordId`
  - `/knowledge`
  - `/roadmap`

## Governance model now present in code

The current governance chain is:

- companies define `defaultManagerPlanningMode`
- agents may override with `managerPlanningModeOverride`
- the server resolves `resolvedManagerPlanningMode`
- `approve_manager_plan` approvals can authorize top-level manager work
- top-level agent issue creation enforces `approvalId` when the resolved mode is `approval_required`

The old goal links are still the storage backbone for roadmap ancestry and project linkage.

## Repo-backed execution contract now present in code

- `heartbeatService` bootstraps Node dependencies inside isolated repo checkouts before local adapter execution when a lockfile and `package.json` are present
- bootstrap state is cached in `workspace_checkouts.metadata.workspaceBootstrap`
- local adapters receive checkout env including checkout id, branch, repo URL, and repo ref
- issue updates to `in_review` / `done` now accept `reviewSubmission` so repo-backed handoffs can persist branch/PR metadata for the reviewer

## Security/runtime corrections included in the merged feature work

The recent executive-record work also shipped follow-up fixes:

- generic `/assets/files` uploads are now limited to inert document MIME types
- asset responses add `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- project health is derived from the full blocker/decision sets before the board truncates visible lists
- server tests now cover those regressions

## Major gaps still open after the current sprint branch

- checkout lifecycle management is still light
  - logical release of active checkout rows exists
  - physical cleanup/reaping is still future work
- attribution normalization still deserves a deeper audit sweep
- notifications/external reporting are still separate work
- knowledge search/retrieval is intentionally lightweight

## Source/build artifacts present

The repository currently includes built output directories such as:

- `server/dist/`
- `ui/dist/`
- `cli/dist/`
- `packages/*/dist/`

`node_modules/` is present locally.

## Docs layout

Two documentation trees exist and are both active in-repo:

- `docs/` (Mintlify-oriented docs, includes API/deploy/start/adapters sections)
- `doc/` (engineering notes/specs/plans and legacy/internal docs)
- `DEV-DOCS/` (workspace-trustworthy execution and architecture snapshot, including the new `ARCHITECTURE.md`)

## Test footprint (high-level)

Verified first-party tests include:

- `server/src/__tests__/*.test.ts`
- `cli/src/__tests__/*.test.ts`
- `packages/adapters/opencode-local/src/server/*.test.ts`
- `packages/adapters/pi-local/src/server/*.test.ts`

(Repository also contains many dependency tests under `node_modules/`, which are not project-authored tests.)

## Quick validation commands

Use these for lightweight local validation:

```bash
git status -sb
git branch --format='%(refname:short)'
pnpm -r typecheck
pnpm test:run
```
