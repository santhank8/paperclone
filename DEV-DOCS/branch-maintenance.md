## Branch actions confirmed from git history

1. The executive briefings feature branch was merged upstream as:
   - `347aaef Add executive briefings and results layer (#1)` on `master`
2. `master` then advanced with:
   - `3db6e13 chore(lockfile): refresh pnpm-lock.yaml`
3. `development` pulled in the merged feature work locally via:
   - `0e5310e Merge branch 'codex/executive-briefings-results-layer' into development`
4. `development` then synchronized with the current remote `master` via:
   - `71a62da Merge remote-tracking branch 'origin/master' into development`
5. The old local feature branch is no longer present.

## Notes that now matter

- `master` contains the squashed GitHub merge of the executive briefings work.
- `development` contains the merged Phase 1 executive-record baseline and lockfile sync.
- `codex/all-phases-executive-sprint` is the current implementation branch for finishing Phases 2-5.
- Do not claim the workspace is clean unless that is re-verified at the time of reading.
