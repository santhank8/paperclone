# The Monitor Agency Design

Date: 2026-03-30
Status: Approved design
Scope: Autonomous monitoring company inside the existing Paperclip instance

## Plain-English Summary

`The Monitor Agency` is a separate company inside Paperclip whose job is to watch the outside world so you do not have to.

In simple terms:

- It watches the tools, services, and competitors that could affect your business.
- It decides what changed and whether the change matters.
- It prepares work automatically: issues, plans, draft pull requests, tests, and low-risk merges.
- It actively looks for new tools, features, and opportunities that could make your products better or your team faster.
- It stays quiet unless a change is important enough that a human decision is actually needed.

This is not a second Paperclip server. It is a new company living inside the same Paperclip you already use.

## Why This Exists

Right now, staying current requires a human to remember to check:

- GitHub releases
- dependency updates
- provider pricing changes
- API deprecations
- model retirements
- competitor launches
- industry news

That creates two problems:

1. Important changes get missed.
2. Even when changes are noticed, someone still has to read them, interpret them, and decide what to do next.

`The Monitor Agency` solves that by making monitoring part of operations instead of a manual chore.

It should also help you get ahead, not just avoid problems. That means it should look for useful new AI tools, feature ideas, and market openings before you ask for them.

## What It Is

`The Monitor Agency` is a dedicated Paperclip company with its own:

- projects
- agents
- routines
- issues
- plans
- pull request workflow

It is separate from your other companies so its work does not clutter normal product work.

## What It Watches

The company has two major lanes of work.

### 1. Platform Monitoring

This lane watches technical changes that can affect your systems:

- `paperclip`
- `openclaw`
- adapter repos
- dependencies
- GitHub Actions and CI changes
- infrastructure and deployment tooling
- provider API changes
- pricing changes
- policy changes
- model launches and retirements
- security-relevant announcements

### 2. Strategic Monitoring

This lane watches business and market changes:

- competitor launches
- competitor feature changes
- major industry news
- ecosystem shifts
- partnerships
- other market signals that suggest a strategy change

### 3. Opportunity Monitoring

This lane looks for things that could make your business faster, better, or more profitable:

- new AI tools that could save time
- new products or services worth integrating
- new workflows that reduce manual work
- new feature ideas for your own products
- new market openings created by technology shifts
- new ways to package, automate, or sell what you already do

## How It Works In Plain English

Think of it like a small operations team.

### Step 1. Watch

The company checks the sources it has been assigned on a schedule.

Examples:

- GitHub releases
- upstream commit history
- changelogs
- provider docs
- pricing pages
- product announcements
- industry sources

### Step 2. Understand

When something changes, it does not just forward a link.

It asks:

- What changed?
- Does this affect us?
- Is this small, risky, urgent, or strategic?
- Does it need code, planning, or no action at all?
- Is this a threat, an opportunity, or both?

### Step 3. Act

Depending on the answer, it can:

- do nothing and log the event
- create an internal issue
- draft a plan
- open a draft pull request
- run tests
- merge low-risk updates automatically
- create a major-decision escalation for you
- create a proactive proposal when it finds something worth exploiting

### Step 4. Escalate Only When Needed

You should not be asked to judge technical details.

You should only be interrupted when the system has already translated the problem into plain English and a real decision is needed.

Examples:

- `This update is low risk and ready to merge.`
- `This upstream change is likely breaking authentication.`
- `This competitor move may require a pricing response.`
- `This provider change creates new cost exposure.`

## Company Structure

Company name:

- `The Monitor Agency`

Projects:

- `Platform Monitoring`
- `Strategic Monitoring`
- `Opportunity Pipeline`
- `Escalations`

## Agent Roles

### Upstream Scout

Finds new technical changes in repos, releases, changelogs, providers, and tooling.

### Dependency Triage

Figures out whether those changes matter and how risky they are.

### PR Operator

Creates dedicated update branches, opens draft pull requests, runs validation, and merges low-risk updates when allowed.

### Provider Watch

Monitors model providers, APIs, pricing, policy shifts, and platform changes.

### Market Intel

Tracks competitor and industry changes and turns those into strategy work when useful.

### Opportunity Hunter

Looks for new AI tools, product ideas, automation opportunities, and workflow improvements that could help you move faster or make more money.

### Executive Escalation

Produces the few messages that should reach you, in plain language, when a real decision is needed.

## Branching and Pull Requests

Automated update work should use clearly separate branch names such as:

- `monitor/paperclip/release-0-3-2`
- `monitor/openclaw/auth-changes-2026-03-30`

Why:

- easy to identify
- easy to filter
- safer to review
- separate from normal product work

## Autonomy Policy

This company is intended to be self-managing.

That means it is allowed to:

- monitor automatically
- classify changes automatically
- create issues automatically
- create plans automatically
- open draft pull requests automatically
- run tests automatically
- merge low-risk changes automatically
- create proactive proposals automatically

It is not intended to wait for a human on routine work.

## Safety Rules

Autonomy is bounded by guardrails.

Auto-merge is allowed only when:

- the change is classified low-risk
- tests pass
- smoke checks pass
- the change does not touch clearly sensitive areas

Sensitive areas include:

- authentication
- permissions
- deployment
- database migrations
- billing
- uncertain or breaking behavior

If a change touches one of those areas, the company should hold it for deeper internal triage and only escalate if a real decision is required.

## Communication Policy

The communication model is intentionally quiet.

Normal work stays inside `The Monitor Agency`.

You only get interrupted for major decisions such as:

- high-risk upstream breakage
- important failing validation
- likely breaking provider changes
- strategic actions with meaningful business consequences
- major opportunities worth funding, shipping, or prioritizing
- changes involving money, permissions, or irreversible action

This means you are not expected to monitor drafts, logs, releases, or technical severity yourself.

## Why Separate Company Instead of Separate Server

It should not be a separate Paperclip deployment.

Using a separate company inside the existing Paperclip instance is better because:

- it uses the same permissions and GitHub connections
- it can create work in the same operating environment
- it stays visible inside the same system
- it avoids another server to maintain
- it remains isolated enough through company boundaries

## Success Criteria

This design is successful when:

- important upstream and market changes are detected without human checking
- low-risk updates are handled automatically
- valuable new tools and feature opportunities are surfaced proactively
- risky changes are translated into plain-English decisions
- you are interrupted rarely
- the company reduces maintenance burden instead of creating a new one

## Rollout Recommendation

Start with a conservative first phase:

- monitor everything
- triage everything
- open draft PRs automatically
- run validation automatically
- auto-merge only clearly low-risk changes
- create opportunity proposals when confidence is high
- log all actions inside `The Monitor Agency`

This provides real autonomy without giving the company unlimited power on day one.

## Non-Goals

This company should not:

- silently make risky production changes
- spam the main inbox with routine updates
- require the user to interpret technical release notes
- become a second full operational Paperclip environment

## Next Step

After design approval, the next artifact should be an implementation plan covering:

- company bootstrap
- project and agent creation
- routine setup
- GitHub and provider watch inputs
- change-classification policy
- branch and PR workflow
- test and merge policy
- escalation pipeline
