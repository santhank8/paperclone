# Grok Sidecar Artifact Steps

## Purpose

Use the logged-in `openchrome-grok` session as a sidecar for:

- public narrative scan
- title and hook challenge
- counter-angle discovery
- editorial / hero image generation fallback

Do not use it as canonical grounding.

## Current operational path

- browser session: `openchrome-grok`
- CDP URL: `http://127.0.0.1:18910`
- sidecar script:
  - `/Users/daehan/ec2-migration/home-ubuntu/board-app/scripts/grok-web-sidecar.js`
- image sidecar script:
  - `/Users/daehan/ec2-migration/home-ubuntu/board-app/scripts/grok-image-sidecar.js`
- system-tools entry:
  - `queryGrokWeb(prompt, options)`
  - `generateGrokImage(prompt, options)`

## Current image-capture contract

For hero/editorial image use, the canonical Grok path is now:

- submit the prompt and verify the submitted payload matches the intended prompt
- wait for generated candidates on `Imagine`
- click a generated candidate
- move into `/imagine/post/...`
- switch to `이미지` mode when needed
- save the final selected image from the post view

Do not treat the first preview tile on `Imagine` as the final image.

If any of the following happen, fail closed and fall back rather than publishing the result:

- prompt submission mismatch
- preview-only image capture
- final selected image not materialized
- low-resolution result

## Research Lead artifact step

Use after RSS shortlist and before NotebookLM grounding:

- output file example: `grok-trend-scan.json`
- purpose:
  - what people may care about
  - what counter-angle may exist
  - what framing may overpromise

## Growth Lead artifact step

Use after draft title or article hook exists:

- output file example: `grok-title-hook-scan.json`
- purpose:
  - alternative title hooks
  - click-risk warnings
  - public-narrative framing check

## Rule

Grok sidecar is a `market/public-narrative layer`.

NotebookLM remains the `canonical grounding layer`.

For visuals, Grok is the preferred provider for:

- hero
- editorial cover
- photoreal or atmospheric framing

Operational note:

- Grok hero generation is now viable for live use only because the sidecar can complete candidate selection and post-view final-image capture.
- `jobId` tracking remains secondary diagnostic metadata; successful capture does not currently depend on `jobId`.

Gemini remains the preferred provider for:

- support comparison
- support workflow
- explainer structure

If Gemini fails on a support visual, Grok can serve as the image fallback before structured fallback is used.
