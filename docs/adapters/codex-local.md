title: Codex Local
summary: OpenAI Codex local adapter setup and configuration
---

The `codex_local` adapter runs OpenAI's Codex CLI locally. It supports session persistence via `previous_response_id` chaining and skills injection through the global Codex skills directory.

## Prerequisites

- Codex CLI installed (`codex` command available)
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` set in the environment or agent config (or `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` — see [OpenRouter](#using-openrouter))

## Configuration Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `cwd` | string | Yes | Working directory for the agent process (absolute path; created automatically if missing when permissions allow) |
| `model` | string | No | Model to use |
| `promptTemplate` | string | No | Prompt used for all runs |
| `env` | object | No | Environment variables (supports secret refs) |
| `timeoutSec` | number | No | Process timeout (0 = no timeout) |
| `graceSec` | number | No | Grace period before force-kill |
| `fastMode` | boolean | No | Enables Codex Fast mode. Currently supported on `gpt-5.4` only and burns credits faster |
| `dangerouslyBypassApprovalsAndSandbox` | boolean | No | Skip safety checks (dev only) |

## Using OpenRouter

[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) provides access to GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and hundreds of other models through a single OpenAI-compatible endpoint.

Set only `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` in the agent's `env` config:

```json
{
  "model": "openai/gpt-4o",
  "env": {
    "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "sk-or-v1-…"
  }
}
```

Paperclip automatically maps `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` → `OPENAI_API_KEY` and sets `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://openrouter.ai/api/v1` for the Codex child process. Usage is tagged as `openrouter` in the billing ledger.

Billing inference also treats the upstream as OpenRouter when **any** of `OPENAI_BASE_URL`, `OPENAI_API_BASE`, `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL`, or `OPENROUTER_API_BASE` points at `openrouter.ai` (some CLIs only export the alternate keys). See the [deploy environment variables reference](../deploy/environment-variables.md) for the full table.

You can also set the variables explicitly (this takes precedence over the auto-mapping):

```json
{
  "model": "anthropic/claude-3-5-sonnet",
  "env": {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-or-v1-…",
    "OPENAI_BASE_URL": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
  }
}
```

If your environment only provides an alternate base-URL key, use `OPENAI_API_BASE` or `OPENAI_API_BASE_URL` instead of `OPENAI_BASE_URL`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "OPENAI_API_KEY": "sk-or-v1-…",
    "OPENAI_API_BASE": "https://openrouter.ai/api/v1"
  }
}
```

See the [OpenRouter model list](https://openrouter.ai/models) for all available models. Model IDs use the `provider/model-name` format (e.g. `openai/gpt-4o`, `anthropic/claude-opus-4-5`, `google/gemini-2.0-flash`).

## Session Persistence

Codex uses `previous_response_id` for session continuity. The adapter serializes and restores this across heartbeats, allowing the agent to maintain conversation context.

## Skills Injection

The adapter symlinks Paperclip skills into the global Codex skills directory (`~/.codex/skills`). Existing user skills are not overwritten.

## Fast Mode

When `fastMode` is enabled, Paperclip adds Codex config overrides equivalent to:

```sh
-c 'service_tier="fast"' -c 'features.fast_mode=true'
```

Paperclip currently applies that only when the selected model is `gpt-5.4`. On other models, the toggle is preserved in config but ignored at execution time to avoid unsupported runs.

## Managed `CODEX_HOME`

When Paperclip is running inside a managed worktree instance (`PAPERCLIP_IN_WORKTREE=true`), the adapter instead uses a worktree-isolated `CODEX_HOME` under the Paperclip instance so Codex skills, sessions, logs, and other runtime state do not leak across checkouts. It seeds that isolated home from the user's main Codex home for shared auth/config continuity.

## Manual Local CLI

For manual local CLI usage outside heartbeat runs (for example running as `codexcoder` directly), use:

```sh
pnpm paperclipai agent local-cli codexcoder --company-id <company-id>
```

This installs any missing skills, creates an agent API key, and prints shell exports to run as that agent.

## Instructions Resolution

If `instructionsFilePath` is configured, Paperclip reads that file and prepends it to the stdin prompt sent to `codex exec` on every run.

This is separate from any workspace-level instruction discovery that Codex itself performs in the run `cwd`. Paperclip does not disable Codex-native repo instruction files, so a repo-local `AGENTS.md` may still be loaded by Codex in addition to the Paperclip-managed agent instructions.

## Environment Test

The environment test checks:

- Codex CLI is installed and accessible
- Working directory is absolute and available (auto-created if missing and permitted)
- Authentication signal (`OPENAI_API_KEY` presence)
- A live hello probe (`codex exec --json -` with prompt `Respond with hello.`) to verify the CLI can actually run
