## Handoff Notes for Support Team

When support@diybrand.app inbox starts receiving mail:

1. **Before replying,** check if answer is in FAQ
2. **If in FAQ,** reply with template + link to FAQ page
3. **If not in FAQ,** reply with template + then add to FAQ afterward
4. **If it's a product bug,** link to support ticket system
5. **If it's a refund,** follow refund policy process (5 steps)

**Philosophy:** Every email is a documentation failure. Fix the docs, not just the email.
