## Notes

This checklist ensures we're ready to launch with zero-support-ticket goal in mind. Every item checked means we're removing friction and preventing customer issues before they happen.

**Philosophy:** The best support is support that's never needed. Every page, guide, and template is designed to answer questions before customers ask them.
