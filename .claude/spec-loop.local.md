# Spec Loop Active

Implementing: spec/20260316-pai-patterns

## Exit Conditions (Dual-Gate)
1. All steps in PLAN.md marked ✅
2. Completion promise output: `<promise>ALL_STEPS_COMPLETE</promise>`

**Both conditions required for clean exit.**

## Circuit Breaker Triggers
- 3 iterations with no step completion → OPEN
- 5 iterations with repeated errors → OPEN

When circuit breaker opens, analyze and fix before continuing.
