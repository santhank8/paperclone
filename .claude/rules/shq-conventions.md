# SHQ Conventions

## Planning & Design Docs

All SHQ-specific planning artifacts go in `doc/shq/`. Subdirectories:

- `doc/shq/plans/` — implementation plans, design docs, brainstorm outputs
- `doc/shq/adrs/` — Architecture Decision Records
- `doc/shq/prds/` — Product Requirements Documents

When using Superpowers skills (`superpowers:brainstorming`, `superpowers:writing-plans`), save plan files to `doc/shq/plans/` with descriptive filenames (e.g. `doc/shq/plans/linear-webhook-design.md`).

Do **not** put SHQ docs in `doc/plans/` or `doc/plan/` — those are upstream Paperclip directories.

## Rules Index

Detailed rules are in sibling files:

| Rule | File | What it covers |
|------|------|----------------|
| Doc templates | `shq-doc-templates.md` | ADR, PRD, and implementation plan formats |
| Fork discipline | `shq-fork-discipline.md` | Isolating SHQ changes from upstream, tracking modifications |
| Linear linking | `shq-linear-linking.md` | Branch, PR, commit, and task naming conventions |
| Heartbeat skills | `shq-heartbeat-skills.md` | Writing autonomous skills for Paperclip's heartbeat model |
| Paperclip dev | `paperclip-development.md` | Contract sync, company-scoping, schema change workflow |
