#
# Rebase master and all feature branches onto the latest upstream/master.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/rebase-upstream.sh [--dry-run]
#
# What it does:
#   1. Fetches upstream/master
#   2. Rebases local master onto upstream/master
#   3. Rebases each feature branch onto master
#   4. Reports status of each branch
#   5. Returns to master when done
#
# If conflicts occur during any rebase, the script pauses and tells you
# which branch failed. Resolve conflicts, run `git rebase --continue`,
# then re-run this script to pick up where it left off.
#
# Feature branches are listed in FEATURE_BRANCHES below. Update this list
# when you create or remove feature branches.
